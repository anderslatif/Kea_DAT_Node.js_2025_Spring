# Mandatory I

Create a website that contains documentation for what you have learned so far.

**Assignment type**: Individual

**Feedback**: There will be feedback. Feel free to also share the website on the general Teams channel so others can see it.

**Hand-in type**: GitHub Classroom. Repository.

**Deadline**: Check GitHub Classroom.

If you do not manage to hand-in the mandatory in time you will have to hand-in in the Teams Channel for approval. A special channel has been created in the Teams room. 

It's very apparent to me you get ChatGPT to generate your descriptions. Don't do it. The point is that you reflect on the topics covered in the course so far.

## Requirements for the project:

- Serve the pages with Express.

- Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR). 

> Note: We will cover SSR just before the final deadline. Create it as a normal client-side rendered website and then refactor later. Do not procrastinate since the refactoring itself will take time. Just create it like we've created websites so far in the course. 

While you are allowed to use my SSR solution, it is valued higher if you have buld upon it or create your own take on it to fit your use case. 

- Split up the documentation in pages rather than one long HTML page.

- Should have some nice styling (custom or with a styling framework).

## Requirements about the documentation:

- Should contain terminal commands.

- Should contain code snippets.

- Should contain all the tools we’ve used and explain them.

- Should cover all the theory (learning goals) that we’ve touched upon.
